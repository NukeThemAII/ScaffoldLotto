## Smart Contract

### KasplexLottery Contract

The main lottery contract (`contracts/YourContract.sol`) implements:

#### Core Functions

```solidity
// Purchase a lottery ticket
function buyTicket(uint8[5] memory numbers) external payable

// Draw the current lottery (automated every 3.5 days)
function drawLottery() external

// Claim prizes for a specific lottery
function claimPrize(uint256 lotteryId) external

// Admin function to withdraw fees
function withdrawAdminFees() external onlyOwner
```

#### View Functions

```solidity
// Get current lottery information
function getCurrentLottery() external view returns (Lottery memory)

// Get user's prize for a specific lottery
function getUserPrize(address user, uint256 lotteryId) external view returns (uint256)

// Get user's tickets for a specific lottery
function getUserTickets(address user, uint256 lotteryId) external view returns (uint8[5][] memory)

// Get time remaining until next draw
function getTimeUntilDraw() external view returns (uint256)
```

#### Events

```solidity
event TicketPurchased(address indexed player, uint256 indexed lotteryId, uint8[5] numbers);
event LotteryDrawn(uint256 indexed lotteryId, uint8[5] winningNumbers, uint256 totalPrizePool);
event PrizeClaimed(address indexed winner, uint256 amount);
```

### Prize Distribution

| Matches | Prize Tier | Percentage |
|---------|------------|------------|
| 5/5     | Tier 1     | 40%        |

## Gas Optimization

- **Contract Size**: 1,981,838 gas (6.6% of block limit)
- **Ticket Purchase**: ~100,000 gas per ticket
- **Lottery Draw**: ~200,000 gas per draw
- **Prize Claim**: ~50,000 gas per claim

## Security Considerations

- **Randomness**: Uses `block.prevrandao` for fair number generation
- **Admin Fees**: Transparent 1% fee structure
- **Prize Pool**: Automatic distribution prevents fund accumulation
- **Access Control**: Owner privileges limited to fee withdrawal and emergency functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checks prevent invalid ticket purchases
